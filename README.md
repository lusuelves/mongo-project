# Ideal spot for your company

We want to locate our Video Games company in a city that satisfies the following conditions:
    1. We need to have a company less than 10 years old that has raised more than 1m dollars, if it's a design company even better.
    2. It would be nice to have Starbucks near.
    3. Also, we would like to be near an airport.
    4. There are employees with children, so we would like to have a school at walking distance.
    5. Our CEO is vegan, so if there's a vegan restaurant near, it would be perfect.

## Approach ðŸš€

Get all the companies that are young and have raised more than 1m dollars. 
With that location, find the nearest school, starbucks, airport and vegan restaurant to those companies. 
With those 5 spots create a 5 point polygon for each company, the center of the smallest polygon is the ideal place for our company.
